# NetSane

NetSane is a chrome browser extension that filters QAnon, conspiracy, fascist and antivax websites and redirects to harmless ones instead.

To install it:
1. Download the extension using the green 'Code' button in the top right, then on 'Download Zip'. 
2. Save the zip file and extract it to a folder somewhere.
3. In Chrome, go to chrome://extensions by clicking on the three dots in the top right, then on 'More tools' and finally 'Extensions'.
4. Click 'Load unpacked' then select the folder you created earlier.
5. That's it!
6. Additional settings can be found by clicking on 'Details' then 'Extension options'.
